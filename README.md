# NaNoGenMo Novel

My intention for this "novel" was similar to the concept behind the "Never Ending Soap-Opera" novel (https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2019/issues/115). I wanted to make a novel that was a bit silly in concept, with it being about someone constantly offering another person ways to "help them". I believe that, by focusing on the repetitive side of this, it made something like offering to help someone a little more unsettling. My original idea, in fact, was that this novel was from the perspective of a malfunctioning robot and/or robot "helper". However, that was mainly an idea that helped me when it came to the overall concept of this novel.

Attached to this repository is the code I used for this project through Google Collab as well as a pdf sample of my novel.
